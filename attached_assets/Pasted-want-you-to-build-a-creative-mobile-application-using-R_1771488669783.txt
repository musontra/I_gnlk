want you to build a creative mobile application using React Native + Expo.

This is a university project. The goal is to transform a simple list-based structure into a meaningful and original concept.

📱 Project Name

“Iyilik Günlüğüm” (My Recovery Journal)

🎯 Core Concept

This is not just a symptom tracker.

It is a personal resilience and emotional well-being tracking app for people going through challenging life phases (health, exams, stress, burnout, etc.).

The app should feel supportive, calming, and empowering.

💡 Unique Idea

Instead of a basic list app, this application allows users to:

Track daily emotional state

Record energy levels

Add small daily wins

View motivational suggestions

See their personal progress over time

The design should reflect emotional support and positivity.
